# 🏗️ Java Engineering

Welcome! This repository serves as a professional portfolio for mid-to-advanced backend projects. While my [Java Learning](https://github.com/YuriiJavaDev/JavaLearning) focuses on core syntax and basic algorithms, this section highlights complex systems, multi-layered architecture, and real-world engineering challenges.

## 🏛️ Featured Engineering Projects (With Full History)

*The following projects were developed under professional mentorship. They include full commit history to demonstrate the evolution of the code, architectural decisions, and the problem-solving process.*

### 💹 [Stock Market System](https://github.com/YuriiJavaDev/stock-market-system)
A high-performance multithreaded simulation of a Stock Exchange.
* **Key Focus**: Advanced thread synchronization using `ExecutorService`, `ReentrantReadWriteLock`, and `CountDownLatch`.
* **Technical Highlights**: 
    * Implemented thread-safe `ConcurrentHashMap` for independent broker portfolios.
    * Developed real-time equity calculation and Profit/Loss (P/L) reporting logic.
    * Verified memory structure and object allocation using **VisualVM**.

### 🎓 [University CMS](https://github.com/YuriiJavaDev/UniversityCMS)
A comprehensive educational management system built with scalability in mind.
* **Key Focus**: Layered Architecture (DAO, Service, Controller) and robust data persistence.
* **Technical Highlights**: 
    * Designed complex PostgreSQL database schemas with multiple relationships.
    * Managed database versions using **Flyway** migrations.
    * Ensured code reliability with comprehensive **JUnit 5** and **Mockito** testing.
